# ShittyUnrealGame
Current Version .002a

# Introduction
Shitty Unreal Game is a shitty FPS/Questing game
Set in the near future 1-10 years, at a time when a distopian development is very possible but not clearly present.
This game will be as realistic as is possible while still being enjoyable. Ideally damage will be 1 to 1, headshot is instadeath and limb damage may be crippling.
The user will have full ability to do whatever they want, whether that is good or bad and each action has its consequence - seen and unseen.

# Requirements
Currently this is only a modern windows program, but can be ported to most.

# Installation
Run the installer.
